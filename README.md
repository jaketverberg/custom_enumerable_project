# Custom Enumerable Project

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. This project will also familiarize you with how to work with blocks and procs. Some starter code and specs are provided to validate the correctness of your solutions.

This project heavily uses block concepts in Ruby.

## Blocks Recreated:

- #my_each
- #my_each_with_index
- #my_select
- #my_all?
- #my_any?
- #my_none?
- #my_count
- #my_map
- #my_inject

## Thoughts

Everything passed the paramiters given by The Odin Project, but I know that there are more scenarios where these recreated blocks would not work in the "real world."

My understanding of 'self' and '&block' has improved immensily.
